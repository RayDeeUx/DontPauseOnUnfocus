#UnpauseOnUnfocus 

Unpauses the game when Geometry Dash is unfocused. The macOS counterpart to Alphalaneous' Windows-only "Pause on Unfocus" mod.

This mod is only available for macOS, because macOS pauses the game when Geometry Dash is unfocused. The code may compile for Windows and Android, but those users are not the target audience.
